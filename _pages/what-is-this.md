Journey Book is a project that we created in which the community of coders can share everything they achieved, experienced, or learned in their life till now.

Example:
- Getting a job (in FAANG, MNCs, startups, remote job)

- Getting an internship (Remote/local) in any companies. -How they have spent their college life and what mistakes they have made and suggestions to their younger self about how they can avoid those mistakes.

- Interview experiences

- Personal branding (youtube, twitter, linkedin, instagram)

- How someone from a non CSE/IT background switched their domain and got into IT jobs.

- How they network with people

- How they started Freelancing

- How they have created their portfolio and got offers.

- How they started open source and what and how they got opportunities open source.
